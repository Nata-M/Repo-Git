                    There's nothing more romantic than Italian food. Italian food is seasonal. It is simple. It is nutritionally sound. It is flavorful. It is colorful. It's all the things that make for a good eating experience, and it's good for you.

                    Open-faced cheese bread, with its bright yellow egg yolk at the centre, the most iconic dish from the Autonomous Republic of Adjara. Adjarian (or Adjaran) khachapuri is a favourite throughout Georgia, and involves participation from the diners who stir the egg into the hot cheese to ﬁnish its cooking. The edges of this khachapuri are quite thick. The diner breaks off a chunk by hand and dips it into the eggy cheese. I like the version where the dough edges are enriched with grated cheese before baking.

                <p>
                    A traditional Mexican dish consisting of a small hand-sized corn or wheat tortilla topped with a filling. The tortilla is then folded around the filling and eaten by hand. A taco can be made with a variety of fillings, including beef, pork, chicken, seafood, vegetables, and cheese, allowing great versatility and variety. The taco predates the arrival of the Spanish in Mexico. There is anthropological evidence that the indigenous people living in the lake region of the Valley of Mexico traditionally ate tacos filled with small fish.

                    Gebjalia is a traditional dish from Samegrelo and means “Made into milk”. It is worth mentioning, that words the Sun and Milk are pronounced similarly in the Megrelian dialect (Georgian language is spoken throughout the country, but in some places dialects are maintained and used between locals. One of such place in Georgia is Samegrelo). We may assume, that Gebjalia was used as a sacred dish during ritual feastings. Gebjalia goes well with Ghomi or Mchadi (Baked corn bread in Georgia).

                    Kimchi is a spicy Korean side dish created from salted, fermented vegetables, usually cabbage and radishes. It gets its unique kick from a paste made of chili powder, garlic, ginger, red pepper and sugar and its recognizable tang from fish sauce.

                    According to records, kimchi dates back as far as the Three Kingdoms of Korea (37 BCE–7 CE). However, kimchi didn’t get its signature red color until around the 16th century.

                    most synonymous with Japanese cuisine and one of Japan’s major symbols, sushi is one of the most mind-boggling yet delicious types of food in the world. The idea of eating raw fish may make you cringe at first, but there’s a reason why it is the beloved food of the Japanese people for centuries and why it has taken the world by storm in recent years. Sushi exists in countless variations and forms, with each region specializing in different fish and styles of cooking. Below are some of the basic types of sushi.
